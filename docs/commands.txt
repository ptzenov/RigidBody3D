	
	SET MOVE TYPE SELECTOR					You specify LINEAR, ARC, HELIX or SEQUENTIAL2
	
	MOVE 									Causes a move of the set type. Values are absolute.
											Sequential2 results in movement along X and Y then Z.
											This does not follow a coordinated interpolation between each axis.
											Occurs at velocity #2

	STEP RELATIVE X							Causes a linear movement to occur. Value is a relative input. 
	STEP RELATIVE Y							
	STEP RELATIVE Z
